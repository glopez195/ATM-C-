# Dummy Bank Application

## Overview
This Dummy Bank application is a C++ project designed to demonstrate my advanced skills in modern C++ development. It represents an evolution from an earlier version of the project, which was more akin to C-style programming. The original project, found in the "Old project" folder, lacks Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and extensively uses manual memory management and raw pointers.

The current version is a complete overhaul of this old codebase. It is restructured to be more readable and organized, showcasing my proficiency in modern C++ features. Key aspects of this transformation include:

- **Adoption of Object-Oriented Design**: This approach provides a clearer structure and more maintainable code by utilizing classes and objects.
- **Smart Memory Management**: Moving away from manual memory allocation and raw pointers to more secure and efficient practices like smart pointers.
- **Use of Lambda Functions**: Demonstrating the use of lambda expressions for more concise and functional programming style.
- **Robust Data Validation**: Implementing comprehensive input and data validation to reinforce expected behavior from users and ensure 
- **Modern C++ Features**: Incorporating features like auto type deductions, range-based for loops, and other C++11 and beyond enhancements.

This project serves not only as a functional banking application but also as a testament to my growth as a programmer, adept in modern C++ techniques and best practices.

## Installation
To use this application, clone the repository and compile the C++ files. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++, clang).
